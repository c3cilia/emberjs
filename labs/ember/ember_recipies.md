###Recipe 1: Creating the super rental app
######Step 1: Create the a new ember app called super-rental

```
ember new super-rentals
```

A few folders are created Automatically.</br>
* App --> contains [models](), [components](), [routes](), [templates](), styles etc.
* bower_components --> [Bower]() is a dependency management tool. In ember CLI it manages HTML, CSS and JS
* config --> configuration settings for the entire app
* dist --> contains built files for deployment
* node_modules --> Ember is built with [node]() and this makes is sort of important.
* public --> for images and fonts 
* vendor --> JS and CSS not managed by bower goes here
* test --> for Ember CLI test runner [testem]()
* tmp --> for temporary files 
* ember-cli-build.js --> This describes [how Ember CLI should build our app]()

Note: Ember users [ECMAScript 2015]()
